## What is Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It builds a dependency graph from all your application's modules and packages them into one or more bundles optimized for deployment.

## Key Concepts

- **Entry**: The starting point(s) from which webpack begins building its dependency graph
- **Output**: Where webpack puts the bundled files
- **Loaders**: Transform files into modules as they are added to the dependency graph
- **Plugins**: Perform wider tasks like bundle optimization or asset management

## Basic Configuration

A typical webpack.config.js looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: 'babel-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'custom.css',
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Webpack and Babel Integration

Babel is a crucial tool that works alongside webpack to transform modern JavaScript code into backwards-compatible versions. In our project, we use the following babel setup:

- **@babel/core**: The core babel compiler
- **@babel/preset-env**: Smart preset for transpiling to ES5
- **babel-loader**: The webpack loader that connects babel to webpack

### Configuration

Our webpack configuration for babel looks like this:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
        },
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures that:

- All .js files (except those in node_modules) are processed by babel
- Modern JavaScript features are transpiled to ES5 compatible code
- The code remains compatible with older browsers

## CSS Processing with MiniCssExtractPlugin

The MiniCssExtractPlugin is used to extract CSS into separate files during the build process. This is important for performance as it allows CSS to be loaded in parallel with JavaScript.

### Plugin Configuration

In our project, we use the following setup for CSS processing:

```javascript
// Plugin initialization
plugins: [
  new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
    filename: 'custom.css',
  }),
],

// Loader configuration
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.scss$/,
      use: [
        MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
        'css-loader',
        'sass-loader'
      ],
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:

- Extracts CSS into a separate 'custom.css' file
- Processes SCSS files through the sass-loader
- Resolves CSS imports via css-loader
- Uses MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader to extract the styles

Benefits:

- Separates CSS from JavaScript bundles
- Enables parallel loading of CSS and JS
- Supports CSS code splitting
- Handles source maps for better debugging

## Common Use Cases

1. **Bundling modules**: Combine many modules into a few bundled assets
2. **Asset transformation**: Convert modern JS, TypeScript, SCSS into browser-compatible code
3. **Performance optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and minification
