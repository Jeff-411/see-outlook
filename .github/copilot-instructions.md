When suggesting changes that involve copying existing values:

- Explicitly verify that values match exactly
- Use checksum/diff tools when appropriate
- Note if you're suggesting any modifications to existing values

Before providing a response:

- Double-check all file paths are correct
- Verify all code snippets compile/parse
- Confirm any quoted values match source exactly
- Highlight any assumptions being made

When showing code changes:

- Mark critical values that must not be altered
- Highlight security-sensitive sections
- Include validation steps for the user

Format responses with clear sections:

1. What changes are being made
2. Why they are needed
3. How to verify the changes
4. Potential risks or considerations
